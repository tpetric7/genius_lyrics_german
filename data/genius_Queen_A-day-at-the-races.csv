[Chorus]And there's all the more reasonFor living or dyingWhen you're youngAnd your troubles are all very small[Bridge]Out here on the streetWe'd gather and meetAnd scuff up the sidewalkWith endlessly restless feetAnd half of the timeWe'd broaden our minds moreIn the pool hall than we didIn the school hallWith the downtownChewing-gum bumsWatching the nightlifeThe lights and the fun[Verse 3]Never wanted to be the boy next doorAlways thought I'd be something moreBut it ain’t easy for a smalltown boyIt ain’t easy at all
