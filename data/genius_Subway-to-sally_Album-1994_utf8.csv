Subway to Sally;Rainman;Album 1994;"A dearth of moisture breaks the earth
To pieces I can't knit to one
(oh, I can't knit to one)
I'm on my way accross the land
To another place as dry as hell
Crumbling, disintegrating grain for grain

The people look to me for help
To ease their pain and nurse their wealth
Their miracle's a curse to me
'cuz somehow somthing follows me
A dark cloud I can't seem to lose
Destined to give what they need take

The rain is falling on my head
The rain falls down

Water, water everywhere
'far back as I can think
As long as I remember I've been swallowed by the drink
Drowning in solutions
Spirits dampened by the downpour
With the problems that I'm solving I'm disolving

In the rain that's falling on my head
The rain falls down";https://genius.com/Subway-to-sally-rainman-lyrics;"Released 1994

Subway to Sally;Queen of Argyll;Album 1994;"Gentlemen, it is my duty
To inform you of one beauty
Though I'd ask of you a favour
Oh' to seek her for a while
Though I own she is a creature
Of character and feature
No worse could paint the picture
Of the queen of all Argyll

On the evening that I mention
I passed with light intention
Through a part of our dear country
Known for beauty and for style
Being a place of noble thinkers
Of scholars and great drinkers
But above them all for splendour
Was the queen of all Argyll

And if you could see her there
Boys, if you had just been there
The swan was in her movement
And the morning in her smile
All the roses in the garden
They'd bow and ask her pardon
For not one could match the beauty
Of the queen of all Argyll

So my lads I need must leave you
My intention's not to grieve you
Nor indeed would I deceive you
But I'll see you in a while
I must find a way to gain her
To court her and to tame her
I fear my heart's in danger
Of the queen of all Argyll

And if you could see her there
Boys, if you had just been there
The swan was in her movement
And the morning in her smile
All the roses in the garden
They'd bow and ask her pardon
For not one could match the beauty
Of the queen of all Argyll

And if you could see her there
Boys, if you had just been there
The swan was in her movement
And the morning in her smile
All the roses in the garden
They'd bow and ask her pardon
For not one could match the beauty
Of the queen of all Argyll

And if you could see her there
Boys, if you had just been there
The swan was in her movement
And the morning in her smile
All the roses in the garden
They'd bow and ask her pardon
For not one could match the beauty

Subway to Sally;Elvis Lives;Album 1994;"When a cold wind blows
And you don't kow where to go
Baby don't be scared, don't be scared
In your darkest night
When nothin' is all right
Baby don't be sad, don't be sad

Elvis is not dead
He comes and goes
In disguise he's on the road

Out there on your own
You're feelin' all alone
Baby don't you cry, don't you cry
On your longest day
You can find your way
Baby don't be blue, don't be blue

Subway to Sally;An der Zeit;Album 1994;"Dort oben leuchten die Sterne
Mit silbern glänzendem Licht
Die sehen aus als hätten sie mich gerne
Ich glaube die sind nicht ganz dicht

Die Nachtvögel dort in den Zweigen
Sind schwarz wie der tiefste See
Sie starren mich an und sie schweigen
Als wären auch sie nicht okay

Ich steh auf der untersten Stufe
Der Weg nach oben ist weit
Es hat keinen Sinn, doch ich rufe
Es ist an der Zeit
Es ist an der Zeit
An der Zeit

Doch stehe ich hier nicht alleine
Die Armee der Verlierer ist groß
Wir stehen wie das Vieh auf der Weide
Und warten auf das große Los

Ich steh auf der untersten Stufe
Der Weg nach oben ist weit
Es hat keinen Sinn mehr, doch ich rufe
Es ist an der Zeit
Es ist an der Zeit

Subway to Sally;The Keach In The Creel;Album 1994;"A fair young maid went up the street
Some white fish for to by
A bonnie clerk's fall'n in love with her
And he followed her by and by
Oh where are you going my bonnie lass
I pray thee tell to me
Oh if the night be never so dark
I'll come and visit thee

My father locks the door at ten
My mother keeps the key
If you were never such a roving blade
You'd never win - in to me
But the clerk he had a brother
And a wily wag was he
He's made him a long ladder
With thirty steps and three

The Rold wife she was standing by
She heard a word was said
I could lay my life, says the silly old wife
There's a man in our daughter's bed
The old man he got out of bed
To see if the thing was true
But she's taken the bonny clerk in her arms
And covered him o'er with blue

Up then got the old silly wife
To see if it were true
And she fell arselins in the creel
And up the string they drew
If that foul thief has gotten you
May he hold you so tight
For you'll never stay in your bed
Nor rest with me at night

He's towed her up, he's towed her down
And given her a right down - fall
Till every rib an the old wife's side
Played nick - nack on the wall
Oh the blue, the bonnie bonnie blue
And I wish it may do well
And every old wife that's jealous of her daughter
Get a good kech in the creel";https://genius.com/Subway-to-sally-the-keach-in-the-creel-lyrics;"Released 1994

Subway to Sally;Bonnie Johnnie Lowrie;Album 1994;"Of a'the lads in tinwald woun
The lovely fair, the black or broun
There never was sae droll a loon
As bonnie Johnnie Lowrie
My dad a peck o'lint did sow
I gaed top see how it did grow
When wha come skipping owre the knowe
But bonnie Johnnie Lowrie

Terry owden dowden day
The queerest loon in laich or brae
Is bonnie Johnnie Lowrie

I wandred oot to weed the same
My laddie ken'd I was frae hame
To follow me ha wasna lame
My bonnie Johnnie Lowrie
I took the flax unto the mill
My jewel follow'd after still
And coming hame I gat a gill
Frae bonnie Johnnie Lowrie

Terry owden dowden day ...

At last, a'e night, into the park
I met with him when it was dark
And, oh, the kissin' that I gat
Frae bonnie Johnnie Lowrie
But Johnnie's true, he did me wed
Yestreen before the priest we gaed
I carena noo for man or dad
Sin' I hae Johnnie Lowrie

Or priest or elder in the toun

Subway to Sally;Down the Line;Album 1994;"I don‘t have any money
All out of nickels and dimes
Ridin‘ around in the subway
Just like a sign of these times
But it‘s fine down the line
At the end of the tunnel
Shines a light I call Sally
And Sally tells me she‘s mine
Any time

Subway to Sally
Ridin‘ from station to station
Sally‘s my destination

Keep your slow boat to China
Your jet plane faster than sound
Keep your luxury liner
I get around underground

Subway to Sally;But We Don’t Know;Album 1994;"I wish I had a hairdryer
To blow you to the moon
I wish I was a bakerman
Curing hunger soon
I wish I had a beaver cap
It looks like Daniel Boone
I keep a wish in my heart

I wish I had a girlfriend
Who would drive me away
I wish I was a president
I'd rule the world all night and day
I wanna' see what's never been seen
I wanna' live in angel's dreams
We're never satisfied

But we don't know what we say

I want to see the holy ghost
But he is anywhere at most
I want to paint a red door black
But painting black makes me feel really bad
Come on lass' we can go together
Let's take the place right now
We're never satisfied

But we don't know what we say";https://genius.com/Subway-to-sally-but-we-dont-know-lyrics;"Released 1994
