"1","AnnenMayKantereit","What He Wanted the Most (Live)","Annenmaykantereit freunde live in berlin","But though he never knew
What a heartache is
He went out for a single kiss

And he told his father
That he's never coming back
But maybe with a broken neck



Oh the Gypsy from the coast
And what he wanted the most
Was being on his own
All alone
In the dark in the light, every night
He wants nobody to the side

And he get's it and let's it and hunt me down
And he told me a story about everytime
He got to be the same as me
And if you like him
Just give him some money, ha!
Oh, come on like him
He's very funny

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey !

That gypsy from the coast
And what he wanted the most
That gypsy from the coast
And what he wanted the most

And all the times that he tried to lie
He was able to satisfy
All of the people around
Listening to his sound
And it was crazy without no doubt

And he get's it and let's it and hunt me down
And he told me a story about everytime
He got to be the same as me
And if you like him
Just give him some money, ha!
Oh, come on like him
He's very funny

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

That gypsy from the coast
And what he wanted the most
That gypsy from the coast
And what he wanted the most

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

That gypsy from the coast
And what he wanted the most
That gypsy from the coast
And what he wanted the most

And though he never knew
What a heartache is
He went out for a single kiss
