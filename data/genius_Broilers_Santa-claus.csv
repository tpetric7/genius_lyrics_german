Pushing through the crowded street
Rows and rows of moving feet
Santa's down the local store
Carol singers at the door
Stockings hanging on the wall
Awaiting for the snow to fall
We don't have to go to school
It's over, it's over, it's over

[Chorus]
Because it's Christmas time again
You know it's Christmas time again

[Verse 2]
I was snitching in the snow
Only one more day to go
Had myself a nasty fall
Landed up in hospital
Only shared the time with you
Now it seems it's very clear
Christmas won't be fun this year
It's over, it's over, it's over

[Chorus]
Because it's Christmas time again
You know it's Christmas time again (Alright, yeah)

[Bridge]
When I woke up on Christmas Day
All my friends had gone away
The things that really make me sad
Is thinking of my Mom and Dad
Presents 'round the Christmas tree
But not a single one for me
The Nurse said „Here is your Family“
It's over, it's over, it's over

[Chorus]
Because it's Christmas time again
You know it's Christmas time again
Because it's Christmas time again
You know it's Christmas time again

Now do it again
Now it's Christmas again
Now it's Christmas, Christmas, Christmas again
Now it's Christmas again
Now it's Christmas again
Now it's Christmas, Christmas, Christmas again

It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
„Won't see another one“
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3]
They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised mе Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4]
You were handsomе, you were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus]
And he boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing „Galway Bay“
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas Day

[Verse 5]
You're a bum, you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you sucker
You cheap, lousy fucker
Happy Christmas, your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus]
And the boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing „Galway Bay“
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas Day

[Verse 6]
„I could have been someone“
Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me, babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Chorus]
And the boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing „Galway Bay“
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas Day

"12","Broilers","Oi! To The World","Santa claus","[Verse 1]
Haji was a punk just like any other boy
And he never had no trouble till he started up his Oi band
Safe in the garage or singing in the tub
Until Haji went too far and he plugged in at the pub
It was a cold Christmas eve when Trevor and the skins
Popped in for a pint and to nick a back of crisps
Trevor liked the music but not the unity
He unwound Haji's turban and knocked him to his knees

[Chorus]
If god came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what he’d say
He'd say „Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
Oi to the world and everybody wins“

[Verse 2]
Haji was a bloody mess, he ran out through the crowd
He said „We'll meet again wе are bloody but not unbowed“
Trevor callеd his bluff and told him where to meet
Christmas day on the roof down at 20 Oxford street

[Chorus]
If god came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what he’d say
He'd say „Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
Oi to the world and everybody wins“

[Bridge]
On the roof with the nun chucks Trevor broke a lot of bones
But Haji had a sword like that guy in Indiana Jones
Police sirens wailing, bloody dying man
Haji was alone and abandoned by his band
Trevor was there fading and still so full of hate
When the skins left him there and went down the fire escape (Oi! Oi!)

[Verse 3]
But then Haji saw the north star shining more then ever
So he made a tourniquet from his turban saving Trevor
They repelled down the roof with the rest of the turban
And went back to the pub where they bought each other bourbon

[Chorus]
If god came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what he'd say
He'd say „Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
Oi to the world and everybody wins“
If god came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what he'd say
He'd say „Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
Oi to the world and everybody wins“ (Oi! Oi!)","https://genius.com/Broilers-oi-to-the-world-lyrics","Released November 12, 2021

"13","Broilers","Father Christmas","Santa claus","[Verse 1]
When I was small, I believed in Santa Claus
Though I knew it was my dad
And I would hang up my stockings at Christmas
Open my presents and I'd be glad
But the last time I played Father Christmas
I stood outside a department store
A gang of kids came over and mugged me
And knocked my reindeer to the floor

[Chorus]
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

[Verse 2]
Don't give my brother a Steve Austin outfit
Don't give my sister a cuddly toy
We don't want no jigsaw or Monopoly money
We only want the real McCoy

[Chorus]
Father Christmas, give us some money
We'll beat you up if you make us annoyed
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys

[Verse 3]
But give my daddy a job 'cause he needs one
He's got lots of mouths to feed
But if you've got one, I'll have a machine gun
So I can scare all the kids on the street

[Chorus]
Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

[Verse 4]
Have yourself a merry, merry Christmas
Have yourself a good time
But remember the kids who got nothing
While you're drinking down your wine

[Chorus]
Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
Father Christmas please hand it over
We'll beat you up so don't make us annoyed
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
Beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

[Strophe 1]
Und es jährt sich wieder mal und ich hab' Angst davor
Wenn alles draußen friedlich ist, komm ich mir seltsam vor
Alle rücken näher, alles ist feierlich
Die Glocken läuten den ganzen Tag nur alles ohne dich

[Refrain]
Und immer wieder dieses Lied
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne
Fünf Minuten noch bis Mitternacht
Du bist immer noch dabei

[Strophe 2]
Vierundzwanzig Tage, eine Woche später, ein ganzes Jahr
Wir hebеn besser Gläser auf das was еinmal war
Mit all den Blitzen und dem Donner und dem Kanonenschlag
Ein ganzes Jahr Silvester im Kopf und du bist nicht mehr da

[Refrain]
Und immer wieder dieses Lied
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne
Fünf Minuten noch bis Mitternacht
Du bist immer noch dabei

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
Fünf Minuten noch bis Mitternacht
Du bist immer noch dabei
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Wir gehen in ein neues Jahr
Du bist immer noch dabei
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
Fünf Minuten noch bis Mitternacht
Du bist immer noch dabei
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Wir gehen in ein neues Jahr
Du bist immer noch dabei","https://genius.com/Broilers-vor-mitternacht-auld-lang-syne-lyrics","Released November 12, 2021
